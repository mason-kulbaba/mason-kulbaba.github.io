my name is marisa kenna and i am a part of the undergraduate biology program at stmu. my research interests focus primarily on plants and ecology. i enjoy being in nature and as primary producers are the baseline for the worlds ecosystem, i find them quite fascinating. to better understand plants, how they adapt and function in certain environments, is to better understand nature as a whole.
