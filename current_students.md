My name is Marisa Kenna and I am part of the undergraduate biology program at stmu, completing my senior capstone project. My research interests focus primarily on plant ecology. I enjoy being in nature as much as possible to see plants in their natural habitat. My research employs aster models to compare variation in life-history traits in paintbrush (_Castillja incarnata_) off the coast of Vancouver Island and in Southern Alberta.
