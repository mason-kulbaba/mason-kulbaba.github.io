My name is Leah Earle and I’m currently enrolled in the undergraduate biology “honors” program at stmu. This year I am completing my honors research project. I have a wide span of research interests including things such as animal and plant ecology, evolution, biological conservation and microbiology. I enjoy being outside and being able to view all the organisms the world has to offer. As well, I love learning new things and being able to share my knowledge with others. Currently, my research is comparing Hymenopteran diversity across different regions of development in rapidly expanding Calgary.

My name is Marisa Kenna and I am part of the undergraduate biology program at stmu, currently completing my senior capstone project. My research interests focus primarily on plant ecology. I enjoy being in nature as much as possible to see plants in their natural habitat to better understand their ecology. My research employs aster models to compare variation in life-history traits in paintbrush (_Castillja incarnata_) off the coast of Vancouver Island and in Southern Alberta. My goal is to quantify the differences is various traits (e.g., flower size/number, flowering duration, etc.) between two very different environments to describe the fitness consequences of region-specific life-history characteristics.
