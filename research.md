# Research

## Current Research 
Most studies of adaptation employ a retrospective approach to describe fitness in terms of historical selection. However, prospective approaches to the study of adaptation have the advantage of observing contemporary changes in fitness and even predicting future change. I employed such a prospective approach by estimating the immediate capacity for adaption in pedigreed populations of the annual legume Partridge Pea (*Chamaecrista fasciculata*). By comparing subsequent generations grown contemporaneously, I determined the extent to which potential adaptation was realized. The rate of adaptation, as described by the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, is related to the additive genetic variation for lifetime fitness: σ<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup>(W). I obtained quantitative predictions of adaptation across consecutive generations through the ratio of σ<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup>(W) to mean population fitness, ̅W. estimating σ<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup>(W) in multiple populations and years found considerable potential for immediate adaptation from standing genetic variation, and a genetically based increase in fitness across generations. A subsequent experiment identified the importance of an interaction between genetically effective population size and density to lifetime fitness and mating system variation. These results directly relate to the potential for evolutionary rescue in vulnerable and declining populations.
